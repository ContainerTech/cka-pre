## Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) 知识点详解

The [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/cka/) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. As the fourth highest velocity open source project, Kubernetes use is exploding.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is committed to growing the community of Kubernetes Administrators, thereby allowing continued growth across the broad set of companies and organizations that are using Kubernetes. Certification is a key step in that process, allowing certified administrators to quickly establish their credibility and value in the job market, and also allowing companies to more quickly hire high-quality teams to support their growth.
